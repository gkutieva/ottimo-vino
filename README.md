# OTTIMO VINO 
The App where you can purchase the best wine.  
The ripeness and intensity of fruit for each wine depends on climate, grape variety, and the stylistic choices of the winemaker â€” particularly the harvest date. Fruit intensity and ripeness can be detected both on the nose in terms of fruit aroma, and on the palate in terms of fruit richness and fleshiness.
